The ARVisuals project is an innovative solution for visualizing 3D models in augmented reality, aimed at improving user interaction with cutting-edge technologies. We strive to make augmented reality accessible to everyone by offering simple and convenient tools for integrating models across various devices.

## Project Setup Instructions:

1. Download the repository via Code — select "Download ZIP" or clone the repository via Git.
2. Place your 3D model files in `.glb` and `.usdz` formats in the `models` folder.
3. Open the `index.html` file and make the following changes:

       src="models/models.glb"
       ios-src="models/models.usdz"

   Replace "models.glb" and "models.usdz" with the names of your models.
4. Publish the project to make it available to users.

Our solution is fully ready for use, thanks to integration with trusted libraries and augmented reality technologies, which significantly reduces development time and simplifies the deployment process for both developers and end users. 3D models can be hosted on GitHub, considering the 25 MB per file limit, or on third-party services for flexibility and ease of use.

I believe that technology should be accessible to everyone and strive to create a platform where everyone can find useful tools and solutions. A lot of time, effort, and knowledge goes into creating a product that will be valuable and useful to many users.

If you are interested in this project and want to support its further development, I would be sincerely grateful for your help. You can make a donation at the following link: [Support the project](https://www.okhrymenko.com/donations).

Thank you for your attention and support! Together, we can make technology more accessible and improve our world.
