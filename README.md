The ARVisuals project is a simple solution for visualizing 3D models in augmented reality. It helps make AR more accessible by providing easy-to-use tools for integrating models on different devices.

## Project Setup Instructions:

1. Download the repository via Code — select "Download ZIP" or clone the repository via Git.
2. Place your 3D model files in `.glb` and `.usdz` formats in the `models` folder.
3. Open the `index.html` file and make the following changes:

       src="models/models.glb"
       ios-src="models/models.usdz"

   Replace "models.glb" and "models.usdz" with the names of your models.
4. Publish the project to make it available to users.

This solution is ready to use and integrates well with existing AR libraries, making it easy to deploy for both developers and end users. You can host 3D models on GitHub (with the 25 MB per file limit) or use third-party services for more flexibility.

I am focused on creating tools that are easy to use and immediately beneficial. ARVisuals can be used for educational purposes, product demonstrations, virtual showrooms, or simply making 3D content more engaging. The idea is to lower the barrier to entry for using AR.

If you like this project and want to support its future development, any contribution is appreciated. You can make a donation at the following link: [Support the project](https://www.okhrymenko.com/donations).
